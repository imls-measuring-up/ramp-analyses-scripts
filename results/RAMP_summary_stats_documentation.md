# Data Table Definitions for the file "RAMP_summary_stats_YYYYMMDD.csv."

Files named "RAMP_summary_stats_YYYYMMDD.csv" include per-IR summary statistics and use ratio 
calculations generated by the script "ramp_summary_stats_normalize_urls.py." 
The script is in the 'scripts' directory of this repository. For these output files, please note
that "YYYYMMDD" will be replaced with the date on which the script was run.

For input, the "ramp_summary_stats_normalize_urls.py " script requires the file "RAMP_IR_base_info.csv," 
which is included with documentation in the 'ir_data' directory of this repository. The script also
requires a subset of RAMP data published on Dryad. The script includes the code necessary to download
these data and save them to the 'ramp_data' directory of this repository. Detailed RAMP data
documentation is provided in the Dryad item record at <https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.fbg79cnr0>. 

## Column definitions and data sources

**ir**

> Data type: string

> Description: Each IR in RAMP is assigned two indices in Elasticsearch. These indices are described below, but for each IR both indices have a common prefix or root that is unique to that IR. This field is essentially a unique identifier for IR in RAMP, and is recommended for scripting batch processes across or independently of index type.

> Data source: Internal RAMP IR configuration data.
